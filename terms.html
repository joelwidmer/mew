    <p>Original UPC labels from eligible products may be submitted only if they were clipped from original product packaging by the final purchaser of the product.  All other UPC labels are not permitted and will be considered invalid submissions in IGA’s sole discretion.  UPC labels that contain invalid or expired codes or are missing codes are invalid.
